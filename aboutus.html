      <h3>About the Project</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Keep Russ Busy</em> was developed as part of 
        <strong>Assignment 1 – Look &amp; Feel</strong> for ISM 6225: 
        App Development for Analytics. The goal was to design a multi-page 
        website that demonstrates professional web design fundamentals and 
        interactive features using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

      <h3>Design &amp; Technologies</h3>
      <p>
        The site consists of four interconnected pages:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Home</strong> – Overview of the theme and layout</li>
          <li><strong>About Us</strong> – Developer profile and reflection</li>
          <li><strong>Manage Mishaps</strong> – Mock CRUD form to create, read, update, and delete “incidents”</li>
          <li><strong>Analytics</strong> – Visualization using Chart.js showing mishaps by category and severity</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Technologies include:
        <ul>
          <li>HTML5 for structure</li>
          <li>CSS3 for styling and responsiveness</li>
          <li>Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity</li>
          <li>Chart.js for data visualization</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </section>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        This project taught me how structure, spacing, and readability 
        influence user experience. It also reinforced my understanding 
        of connecting pages with consistent navigation and styling.
      </p>
      <button id="toggleMore">Show more</button>
      <p id="moreText" style="display:none; margin-top:10px;">
        I found it rewarding to see how small pieces of JavaScript 
        could make a simple site interactive and engaging. 
        The Manage Mishaps page demonstrates CRUD logic with no database, 
        while the Analytics page integrates Chart.js for visual insights. 
        Overall, this assignment strengthened both my technical and design 
        confidence as I continue developing applied analytics projects.
